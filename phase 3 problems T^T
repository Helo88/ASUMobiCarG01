using only coding during this phase doesn't seem a very bad idea for us ....
variable distanse & angles works fine for a while till we notice the error precentage is increasing ,to reduce it some code equations are modified 
for we get an acceptable precentage.   
again it works fine & again error precentage is increasing while trying to know why ,some of simple car movments (forward ,backward) error 
affects them so badly instead of goning back and forth in a semi straight line line it goes curvy...
honestly we 've no idea that the high volt (11 v) 'll affect the yellow dc motor (i don't recommend those motors to u)
efficiency so fast (as i mentioned befor we changed the motors at phase one) 
& it isn't the easiest thing to almost rebuild the car from the begining 3 days befor the deadline ,but we go through & the car works fine again
instead of using 11 v we use almost 7 v (two  batteries )  so another 2 problems appear to the surface the car performace is changing with the supply volt
+ the speed is much lower than it used to be ..
the second problem is solved by some code modifications ,for the first one u can use a volt regulator (but we cann't find a holder (for 3  batteries)
anywhere (best solution)or u can modify the code to get the best performance at a certain voltage.
