//A simple sound activated bot, turn On when there is a sound and turn off if it hear sound again, It don't have any specific purpose just a toy with minimum intelligence lol.

This robot uses sound detecting sensor, which actually produces vibration whenever there is a noise, it cannot measure the db of the sound that producing, all it can do is to produce a signal when there is a sound .

int Tomotor1 = 8; 
int Tomotor2 = 9;
int soundsensor = 7;   // input from sound sensor

boolean state = false;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(Tomotor1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Tomotor2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(soundsensor, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  if (digitalRead(soundsensor) == LOW)
  { 
    delay(100);                     
    state = !state;               
    digitalWrite(Tomotor1, state);   
    digitalWrite(Tomotor2, state);   

  }
}
